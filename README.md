EasyNav is a GPS navigation tool for Android which aims to make it as simple as possible to find your way to any location on Earth, defined by you. It provides self-contained navigation which requires GPS connectivity only - there is no need to be online to download maps or local information because EasyNav doesn't use them.

The interface allows you to switch between user-defined waypoints and will provide distance, direction and relative altitude information for the chosen destination. The app doesn't provide routing, traffic or local area information, but this is part of its beauty.

If you are out on a drive, walking in the wilderness or even lost in the middle of the desert, all you have to do is acquire a GPS connection on your device, open EasyNav and enter the coordinates of your destination to receive enough info to find your own way there.
